making a module stateful
========================



needs update and toggle functions that chage state values (rather than editing values directly)

update - for sliders and xys
toggle - for booleans

change control registry funciton to use change function, rather than updating the value

add the module state variables to state.js

if the value is a booolean, find the indicator in the deck HTML and add parameter:
state-id='name_of_state_id'
so it can be found when the state is updated

IMPORTANT
- try to make state name variables match the control name in control registry
  - If not, add state-id='name_of_state_id'
- dont change control names in control registry, peoples midi maps will break




things to look into
=======================


will automations automatically end when a module is not running?
